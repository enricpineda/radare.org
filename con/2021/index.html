Hey radare friends, 2020 is over, it's time for the vaccination and recovery!
So here we go again. Welcome to the 6th annual sacred event of r2con! 

r2con is the annual conference of radare2, aims to gather all of the r2 users
of this planet (or other planets too in the future), where developers come to
enjoy three full days of binary hacking know-how, education, discussion,
experiments, competitions and coding, while we all can have fun and drink beers,
sake or ratafia (safely at home).

Like in the last year, the event will be fully online and there's no access
restriction or ticket price.
